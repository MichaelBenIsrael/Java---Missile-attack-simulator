# Missile attack simulator ðŸš€

## âš¡ Intro
This program was made for my first ever job interview.\
At that point I only had about a week of experience with Java (#DontJudge)\
I learnt a lote from this project and it was importent for me to iclude it in my github,\
even as just a reminder for myself, where I started and what I'm capable of now :)

Gets as an input: Area boundaries, targets location, amount of missiles and\
standart devation

The program basically performs hundreds of simulations of attack and\
returns the possibility of hitting all of the given targets.
